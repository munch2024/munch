    Calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.

    Args:
        a (float): Length of one side of the triangle.
        b (float): Length of the other side of the triangle.

    Returns:
        float: Length of the hypotenuse.

    # Alternative route to increase readability by expanding the equation
    # return math.sqrt(a * a + b * b)

    # Using math.hypot increases readibility and optimization as it takes in two
    # parameters in and returns the hypotenuse using the pythagorean theorem

side1 = 3
side2 = 4
